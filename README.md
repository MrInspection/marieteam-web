MarieTeam Projects is a series of three distinct school projects, each focused on building a different type of application: a web application, a desktop application, and a mobile app.

The MarieTeam Web application implements a booking system, allowing users to select a trip, configure their seats, and proceed to checkout. It uses a solid technical stack to achieve the intended functionality and user experience.

## ü™õ Development Stack

- `Next.js 14`
- `TailwindCSS`
- `Shadcn UI`
- `Prisma & Neon Database`
- `Auth.js`
- `Stripe`
- `Zod`

## ‚ö°Features 

- Payment Gateway Integration with Stripe
- User Authentication with Auth.js
- Booking System with Prisma
- Administration dashboard with statistics data

## üß† What I learned ?

### üí∞ Stripe Integration:

- I have learned how to set up and create a Stripe checkout Session. I have also implemented an API route to received the metadata from the checkout session and update the user's payment status in the database.

### ‚úÖ Unit Testing:



## üîç How can it be improved ?

- Make the admin dashboard like a CRUD dashboard
- Have a map to view the route of the crossing
- An illustration of the boat to be able to select the seat
